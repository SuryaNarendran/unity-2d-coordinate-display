# 2D coordinate display helper for Unity
a simple editor script that lets you see the grid coordinates that your mouse is hovering on in the scene window in 2D mode

Add the scripts to a folder named 'Editor' inside your assets folder. Then you can toggle the coordinates from the 'Tools' menu on the top.

this script relies on the very helpful MouseHelper.cs (included)
